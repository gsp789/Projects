In this Project, We will implement the following problem using four different concurrency models.

We will create a program that will recursively compute the number of links starting at 
a URL. For example, given http://www.cs.uh.edu, it will count all the <A> tags, 
navigate to each one of them and recursively compute the links from there. The application 
will finally report the number of sublinks starting at the given URL and the time
it took to compute (for each of the four models).

1. Write the code using sequential solution, only one thread.

2. Write the code using synchronization (threads and locks).

3. Write the code using STM.

4. Write the code using actors.
