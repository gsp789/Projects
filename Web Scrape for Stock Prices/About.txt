A user has stocks in many companies. This project helps in finding the net asset value of their stocks and display it.

The program will read a file which has details of stock symbols and the number of shares of each stock the user owns.
For example
XYZ1 1000
XYZ2 1500
XYZ3 2312
...
XYZI 1000
XYZJ 1000

Assuming the price for each of those stocks on the top is $1, $2, and $3, and the stocks at the bottom are either invalid or runs into error when fetching.
Then the output would look like:

Symbol  Shares  Net Asset Value
--------------------------------
XYZ1  	1000		$1000.00
XYZ2		1500		$3000.00
XYZ3  	2312  	$6936.00
...
Total       $.....total of all the net asset values...

Errors:
XYZI  Invalid stock symbol
XYZJ  Error reaching the network

You may obtain the stock price from the URL http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=SYMBOL where SYMBOL should be replaced by a symbol.
The second line of the output from this URL is a set of numbers. The number past the last comma is the value you want to use.
